# Bike part information   
TODO: summary, explain what this article accomplishes exactly

# Material
For almost all parts: steel, aluminium, and carbon fibre are potential materials. Carbon fibre is stiff and light, but expensive. Aluminium offers the best value for money at a decent weight and price. Steel is heavy and cheap. Each material has a unique aesthetic.   

# Wheels
Tyre and rim diameters are a confusing mess at first glance. For road bikes, 700C is the standard. This corresponds to 28" or 622mm. 29" is occasionally mentioned, this is simply a 28" tyre with a very thick profile.   
   
# Frameset   
The frameset consists of frame, fork, stem, seatpost, and handlebars as well as various other parts to connect everything together. The build will likely be centred around the frame or vice versa - it restricts many part choices and defines the bike's aesthetic.   
**Delihea Tank G5**   
**Material**: Carbon fibre   
**Geometry**: Endurance   
**Brake type**: Disc   
**Drivetrain type**: Chain   
**Tyre/rim size**: 700C   
**Tyre clearance**: 28 mm   
**Front axle**: 12 x 100 mm   
**Rear axle**: 12 x 142 mm   
**Disc rotor size**: 140 mm / 160 mm   
**Bottom bracket standard**: BSA68   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
A more sporty geometry is less comfortable, but more aerodynamic.   
Chosen bottom bracket must fit (indirectly must match crankset).   
Brake setup must match. In case of disc brakes, rotor size must fit.   
Front and rear axle measurements need to match front and rear hubs respectively.   
Chosen tyres must be within tyre clearance.   
Drivetrain must match (chain setup, belt setup).   
   
# Drivetrain   
## Chain   
**SRAM Force 12-speed PowerLock**   
**Gearing**: 12-speed   
**Standard**: SRAM Flattop   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Only present on chain setups (as opposed to belt setups).   
Gearing must match cassette, chainrings, and derailleurs.   
Standard has to be double-checked - Flattop is SRAM-specific.   
## Shift levers   
**Force eTap AXS HRD**   
**Type**: Electronic   
**Shape**: Drop bar   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Type must match derailleurs.   
Shape should match handlebars.   
## Cassette   
**SRAM XG-1270 12-speed Cassette**   
**Gearing**: 12-speed   
**Sprocket sizes**: 10-33   
**Freehub type**: SRAM XDR   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Gear ratio matters. A 10-36 cassette will be more suitable for climbing but bottom out faster at high speeds. The opposite applies for a 10-28 cassette. A wider range means less granularity between gears (i.e. larger jumps when shifting).   
Maximum sprocket size must fit rear derailleur.   
Gearing must fit cassette, chain, and both derailleurs.   
Gear ratio needs to be considered.   
## Crankset   
**SRAM Force DUB 12-speed Carbon Crankset**   
**Material**: Carbon fibre with aluminium chainrings   
**Gearing**: 12-speed    
**Chainring count**: 2   
**Chainring sizes**: 33-46   
**Arm length**: 172.5 mm   
**Bottom bracket**: DUB   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Gear ratio matters. Lower teeth counts are more suitable for climbing, higher teeth counts are better at high speeds.   
Chosen bottom bracket must fit (indirectly must match frame).   
Gearing must fit cassette, chain, and both derailleurs.   
Chainring size and range must fit front derailleur.   
## Bottom bracket   
One of the most confusing parts to choose - there are several standards. The bottom bracket connects the crankset to the frame.    
**SRAM DUB BSA**   
**Spindle length**: 28.99 mm (DUB)   
**Width**: 68 mm   
**Standard**: BSA68   
**Bearing material**: Steel   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Spindle length must match crankset.   
Width + standard must match frame.   
   
## Brakes   
There are two main types of brake systems (rim brakes, disc brakes). Parts can't be mixed and matched between them. The frame and rims must be compatible with the chosen system.   
## Brake levers   
**Force eTap AXS HRD**   
**Type**: Hydraulic disc   
**Shape**: Drop bar   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Typically bundled with the caliper.   
Shape should match type of handlebars.   
## Brake calipers   
**Force eTap AXS HRD**   
**Type**: Disc brake   
**Mounting mechanism**: Flat Mount   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Might have to be adapted to be able to mount to frame.   
## Brake rotors   
**SRAM Centerline Rounded XR Center Lock**   
**Locking mechanism**: Center lock   
**Diameter**: 140 mm + 160 mm   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Diameter must match frame.   
   
## Tyres   
**Schwalbe Pro One Evolution ADDIX Super Race TLE 28"**   
**Diameter**: 700C   
**Width**: 25 mm   
**Pressure**: 6 - 8 bar   
**Type**: Clincher, tubeless ready   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Width must match rims and frame clearance.   
Tubes may or may not be needed depending on type.   

## Rims   
**FALCON PRO RIM AR45 disc**   
**Material**: Carbon fibre   
**Diameter**: 700C   
**Depth**: 45 mm - a deeper rim is more aerodynamic, less stable in crosswinds, and has a certain aesthetic.   
**Type**: Clincher, tubeless ready   
**Brakes**: Disc brakes   
**Hole count**: 28 H   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Tyres (and potentially tubes) must match in type, diameter, and width.   
Brakes must match the rim - it can support either disc brakes or rim brakes.   
   
# Hubs   
When building the wheel from scratch, measurements must be taken so that the hub hole count, spoke length, and nipple length all match.   
## Front hub   
**DT Swiss 240 Classic Road Disc Center Lock**   
**Width**: 12 x 100 mm   
**Hole count**: 28 H   
**Material**: Aluminium   
**Bearing material**: Steel   
**Spoke type**: J-bend   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Width must match frame.   
Hole count must match rims.   
Measurements are important in determining spoke and nipple length.   
## Rear hub   
**DT Swiss 240 Classic Road Disc Center Lock**   
**Width**: 12 x 142 mm   
**Hole count**: 28 H   
**Material**: Aluminium   
**Bearing material**: Steel   
**Freehub**: SRAM XDR (12-speed)   
**Spoke type**: J-bend   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Width must match frame.   
Freehub is typically included and must match cassette. Washers might be needed.   
Hole count must match rims.   
Measurements are important in determining spoke and nipple length.   

## Pedals   
**Shimano PD-M520**   
**Type**: Clipless SPD   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Should match shoes and use case.   

## Seat   
**prologo Dimension Tri Nack**   
**Material**: Carbon fibre   
 --- 
### Considerations / Dependencies   
Seat fit is the most important variable and almost entirely subjective.   

# Miscellaneous parts   
Some parts need to be present but don't fit nicely into the categories above or that are not essential.   
## Bar tape   
Drop bars should probably be wrapped in bar tape for comfort and grip.   
## **Spokes / Nipples**   
When wheelbuilding, getting the spoke and nipple length right is crucial.
